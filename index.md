## Skills required

To make books this way, you need some web-development know-how. You'll edit content in markdown with Liquid template tags; edit data in YAML files; commit your changes with Git; enter commands at the command line; and build and serve a static website. Design is done in Sass. Many features are written in Javascript.

If those concepts are not familiar to you, you'll need a web developer on your team to get you going, and to provide you with technical support when you get stuck.

You can also hire [Electric Book Works](https://electricbookworks.com) to handle setup or book production for you.
