### **1** 
大學之道，在明明德，在親民，在止於至善。知止而后有定，定而后能靜，靜而后能安，安而后能慮，慮而后能得。物有本末，事有終始，知所先後，則近道矣。

-   The Way of Great Learning, is in emanating bright virtue, closeness with people, and stopping when arriving at goodness.
-   Knowing when to stop leads to stability,
-   Being stable leads to being able to be still,
-   Being still leads to being able to be ease,
-   Being at ease leads to being able to think things through,
-   Thinking things through leads to comprehension.
-   Things have their roots and branches,
-   Matters have endings and beginnings.
-   Knowing what’s before and after is being close to the Way.
