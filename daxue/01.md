### **1** 
大學之道，在明明德，在親民，在止於至善。知止而后有定，定而后能靜，靜而后能安，安而后能慮，慮而后能得。物有本末，事有終始，知所先後，則近道矣。

-   The Way of Great Learning, is in emanating bright virtue, closeness with people, and stopping when arriving at goodness.
-   Knowing when to stop leads to stability,
-   Being stable leads to being able to be still,
-   Being still leads to being able to be ease,
-   Being at ease leads to being able to think things through,
-   Thinking things through leads to comprehension.
-   Things have their roots and branches,
-   Matters have endings and beginnings.
-   Knowing what’s before and after is being close to the Way.

古之欲明明德於天下者，先治其國；欲治其國者，先齊其家；欲齊其家者，先修其身；欲修其身者，先正其心；欲正其心者，先誠其意；欲誠其意者，先致其知，致知在格物。物格而後知至，知至而後意誠，意誠而後心正，心正而後身修，身修而後家齊，家齊而後國治，國治而後天下平。自天子以至於庶人，壹是皆以修身為本。其本亂而末治者否矣，其所厚者薄，而其所薄者厚，未之有也！此謂知本，此謂知之至也。

-   The ancients desiring to illustrate bright virtue under Heaven, first governed their nations;
-   Desiring to govern their nations, they would first harmonize homes;
-   Desiring to harmonize the home, they would first cultivate themselves;
-   Desiring to cultivate themselves, they would first rectify their hearts;
-   Desiring to rectify their hearts, they would first sincerely intend for it;
-   Desiring to sincerely willing for it, they would first extend knowledge;
-   Extending knowledge lies in studying underlying principles. 
-   When underlying principles are studied, knowledge is extended.
-   When knowledge is extended, their intentions are sincere.
-   When intentions are sincere, their hearts are rectified.
-   When their hearts are rectified, their self is cultivated.
-   When the self is cultivated, their homes harmonize.
-   When homes harmonize, nations are governed properly.
-   Nations being governed properly, then brings all under Heaven peace.
-   From the Son of Heaven to the common people, every individual’s self-cultivation is the root.
-   Roots in disorder makes it impossible for branches to be well-ordered.
-   Treating important things as minor, and minor things as important,
-   such a thing has never existed!
-   
-   This is called knowing the roots,
-This is called the Ultimate knowledge.

所謂誠其意者，毋自欺也，如惡惡臭，如好好色，此之謂自謙，故君子必慎其獨也！小人閑居為不善，無所不至，見君子而後厭然，掩其不善，而著其善。人之視己，如見其肺肝然，則何益矣！此謂誠於中，形於外，故君子必慎其獨也。曾子曰：「十目所視，十手所指，其嚴乎！」富潤屋，德潤身，心廣體胖，故君子必誠其意。

-   What is called sincere intentions is through not deceiving oneself,
-   It is as if hating foul stenches,
-   as if loving beautiful colors,
-   all of this is called self-humbleness,
-   thus a Gentleman must be cautious when alone.
-   When small people are unoccupied, they act evilly, stopping at nothing.
-   Upon seeing a person of noble character, afterwards they feel loathing,
-   covering up their despicableness, boasting their own virtues.
-   But if others see through you, able to perceive your nature and innermost thoughts,
-   then what use is it?
-   This is called what is sincerely within appears outward,
-   Thus a Gentleman must be cautious when alone.
-   Zengzi said: “The eyes of ten are looking, and the fingers of ten are pointing—how scrupulous is this!”
-   Wealth embellishes homes, virtue embellishes the self,
-   Big hearted with a healthy self,
-   Thus a Gentleman must make their intentions sincere.

《詩》云：「瞻彼淇澳，菉竹猗猗。有斐君子，如切如磋，如琢如磨。瑟兮僩兮，赫兮喧兮。有斐君子，終不可諠兮！」「如切如磋」者，道學也；「如琢如磨」者，自修也；「瑟兮僩兮」者，恂慄也；「赫兮喧兮」者，威儀也；「有斐君子，終不可諠兮」者，道盛德至善，民之不能忘也。《詩》云：「於戲前王不忘！」君子賢其賢而親其親，小人樂其樂而利其利，此以沒世不忘也。

-   The Book of Songs says:
-   {:.indent-3}"Gazing at the banks of the river of Qi,
-   {:.indent-3}Where the lush bamboo flourishes.
-   {:.indent-3}There stands the graceful gentleman,
-   {:.indent-3}Like jade being cut and polished,
-   {:.indent-3}Like stone being carved and ground.
-   {:.indent-3}Solemn and reverent, bright and vibrant,
-   {:.indent-3}There stands the graceful gentleman,
-   {:.indent-3}Whom we shall never forget!"

-   The phrase "like stone being carved and grounded" refers to self-cultivation.
-   The phrase "solemn and reverent" expresses cautious reverence.
-   The phrase "bright and vibrant" signifies bearing dignity and presence.
-   The phrase "the graceful gentleman, whom we shall never forget" refers to their blossoming great virtue and supreme goodness, which people cannot forget.
-   The Book of Songs also says:

-   A gentleman values the virtuous and cherishes those close to him, while a small person enjoys his pleasures and pursues his interests. 
-   This is why the gentleman’s virtue endures through generations and is never forgotten.

湯之盤銘曰：「茍日新，日日新，又日新。」《康誥》曰：「作新民。」《詩》曰：「周雖舊邦，其命惟新。」是故君子無所不用其極。

-   Tang's basin inscription says: "Urgently refresh oneself, day after day is newness, thus the day is anew."
-   The Kang Gao says: "Make the people anew."
-   The Book of Songs says: "Though Zhou is an ancient state, its mandate was ever renewed."
-   Therefore, to the gentleman, there is nothing he doesn’t make use to the utmost.

《詩》云：「邦畿千里，惟民所止。」《詩》云：「緡蠻黃鳥，止于丘隅。」子曰：「於止，知其所止，可以人而不如鳥乎？」《詩》云：「穆穆文王，於緝熙敬止！」為人君，止於仁；為人臣，止於敬；為人子，止於孝；為人父，止於慈；與國人交，止於信。

-   The Book of Songs says: "The capital territory extends a thousand li, where the people find their dwelling."
-   The Book of Songs also says: "The yellow bird chirps and rests at the corner of the hill."
-   Confucius said: "To rest, knowing where one should rest—can people be less aware of where to stop than birds?"
-   The Book of Songs also says: "Solemn and majestic was King Wen, shining brightly as he rested in reverence!"
-   As a ruler, one should rest in benevolence.
-   As a minister, one should rest in respect.
-   As a son, one should rest in filial piety.
-   As a father, one should rest in kindness.
-   In dealings with others, one should rest in trustworthiness.
{:.verse}

子曰：「聽訟，吾猶人也，必也使無訟乎！」無情者不得盡其辭，大畏民志。此謂知本。

-   Confucius said: "In hearing disputes, I am like any other person. But the importance is to ensure there are no disputes at the start!"
-   Those who are insincere or without virtue should not be allowed to fully present their arguments, the will of the people is to be respected greatly.
-   This is called knowing the root.
{:.verse}

### **9**
所謂修身在正其心者：身有所忿懥，則不得其正；有所恐懼，則不得其正；有所好樂，則不得其正；有所憂患，則不得其正。心不在焉，視而不見，聽而不聞，食而不知其味。此謂修身在正其心。

-   What is meant by "self-cultivation lies in rectifying the heart" is this:
-   If the body is filled with anger or resentment, the heart cannot be rectified.
-   If there is fear, the heart cannot be rectified.
-   If there is excessive joy or indulgence, the heart cannot be rectified.
-   If there is worry or anxiety, the heart cannot be rectified.
-   -   
--  When the mind is not focused, one looks but does not see, listens but does not hear, and eats without tasting the flavor.
-   This is what is meant by "self-cultivation lies in rectifying the heart."
{:.verse}

### **10**
所謂齊其家在修其身者：人之其所親愛而辟焉，之其所賤惡而辟焉，之其所畏敬而辟焉，之其所哀矜而辟焉，之其所敖惰而辟焉。故好而知其惡，惡而知其美者，天下鮮矣！故諺有之曰：「人莫知其子之惡，莫知其苗之碩。」此謂身不修不可以齊其家。

-   What is meant by "harmonizing the family lies in cultivating oneself" is this:
-   People tend to be biased toward those they love and cherish, biased against those they despise, biased towards those they fear and respect, biased toward those they pity, and biased toward those they indulge or neglect.
-   Thus, loving someone while still recognizing their flaws, or to disliking someone while still acknowledging their virtues, this is rare under Heaven!
-   Therefore, there is an old saying: "No one sees the faults of their own child; no one sees the deficiencies in their own crops."
-   This means that if one does not cultivate oneself, one cannot bring harmony to one’s family.
{:.verse}

### **11**
所謂治國必先齊其家者，其家不可教而能教人者，無之。故君子不出家而成教於國：孝者，所以事君也；弟者，所以事長也；慈者，所以使眾也。《康誥》曰：「如保赤子」，心誠求之，雖不中不遠矣。未有學養子而後嫁者也！一家仁，一國興仁；一家讓，一國興讓；一人貪戾，一國作亂。其機如此。此謂一言僨事，一人定國。堯、舜率天下以仁，而民從之；桀、紂率天下以暴，而民從之。其所令反其所好，而民不從。是故君子有諸己而後求諸人，無諸己而後非諸人。所藏乎身不恕，而能喻諸人者，未之有也。故治國在齊其家。《詩》云：「桃之夭夭，其葉蓁蓁；之子于歸，宜其家人。」宜其家人，而後可以教國人。《詩》云：「宜兄宜弟。」宜兄宜弟，而後可以教國人。《詩》云：「其儀不忒，正是四國。」其為父子兄弟足法，而後民法之也。此謂治國在齊其家。

-   What is meant by "to govern the state, one must first harmonize one’s family" is this:
-   If a family cannot be properly taught, how can one teach others? 
-   There is no such thing.
-    
-   Therefore, a gentleman does not need to step outside his home to set an example for the nation.
-   Filial piety is how one serves the ruler.
-   Brotherly respect is how one serves elders.
-   Kindness is how one leads the people.
-   
-   The Kang Gao says: "Care for the people as you would a newborn child." 
-   If one seeks with sincerity, even if one does not fully succeed, one will not be far from the mark. 
-   There has never been a case where someone learned to raise children before they got married!
-   When a family practices benevolence, the state will be filled with benevolence. 
-   When a family practices humility, the state will be filled with humility. 
-   If one person is greedy and violent, the entire state will fall into disorder. 
-   Such is the power of the family as the foundation.
-   This is why it is said: "One word can ruin an affair; one person can stabilize a nation." 
-   
-   Yao and Shun led the world with benevolence, and the people followed them. 
-   Jie and Zhou led with tyranny, and the people followed them. 
-   When a ruler commands against what they truly value, the people will not obey.
-
-   Thus, a gentleman first examines himself before demanding anything of others, and ensures there is nothing wrong in himself before criticizing others. 
-   No one who harbors unkindness in their own heart can successfully guide others.
-   Therefore, the governance of the state begins with harmonizing the family.
-   
-   The Book of Songs says:
-   {:.indent-2}"The peach tree blossoms luxuriously, its leaves flourishing. When the bride goes to her new home, she brings harmony to her family."
-   When one brings harmony to their family, they can then teach the people of the nation.
-   
-   The Book of Songs also says:
-   {:.indent-2}"Be a good elder brother and a good younger brother."
-   When one is a good brother, they can then teach the people of the nation.
-   
-   The Book of Songs also says:
-   {:.indent-2}"He conducts himself with dignity, setting an example for the four corners of the nation."
-   
-   When a person is an exemplary father, son, elder brother, and younger brother, the people will follow their example.
-   This is what is meant by: "To govern the state, one must first harmonize one’s family."
{:.verse}

### **12**
所謂平天下在治其國者：上老老而民興孝，上長長而民興弟，上恤孤而民不倍，是以君子有絜矩之道也。所惡於上，毋以使下；所惡於下，毋以事上；所惡於前，毋以先後；所惡於後，毋以從前；所惡於右，毋以交於左；所惡於左，毋以交於右。此之謂絜矩之道。《詩》云：「樂只君子，民之父母。」民之所好好之，民之所惡惡之，此之謂民之父母。《詩》云：「節彼南山，維石巖巖。赫赫師尹，民具爾瞻。」有國者不可以不慎，辟則為天下戮矣。

-   What is meant by "bringing peace under Heaven lies in governing the state" is this:
-   When the rulers honor the elderly, the people will be inspired to practice filial piety.
-   When the rulers respect their elders, the people will be inspired to show fraternal respect.
-   When the rulers care for the lonely, the people will not act with cruelty.
-   Thus, a gentleman practices the Way of the Propriety:
-	{:.indent-3}What one dislikes being done by those above, do not impose on those below.
-	{:.indent-3}What one dislikes being done by those below, do not do in service to those above.
-	{:.indent-3}What one dislikes in those ahead, do not impose on those who follow.
-	{:.indent-3}What one dislikes in those behind, do not impose on those ahead.
-	{:.indent-3}What one dislikes in those on the right, do not impose on those on the left.
-	{:.indent-3}What one dislikes in those on the left, do not impose on those on the right.
-   This is called the Way of the Propriety.
-   
-   The Book of Songs says:
-   {:.indent-2}"Joyful is the noble gentleman, the parent of the people."
-   What the people love, love it too; what the people hate, hate it too. This is what it means to be the parent of the people.
-
-   The Book of Songs also says:
-   {:.indent-2}"Towering is the South Mountain, solid and majestic like stone. Glorious Minister Yin! all the people look to you."
-Those who hold a nation cannot afford to be careless. If they deviate from the Way, they will become a disgrace under Heaven.
{:.verse}

### **13**
《詩》云：「殷之未喪師，克配上帝。儀監于殷，峻命不易。」道得眾則得國，失眾則失國。是故君子先慎乎德。有德此有人，有人此有土，有土此有財，有財此有用。德者本也，財者末也，外本內末，爭民施奪。是故財聚則民散，財散則民聚。是故言悖而出者，亦悖而入；貨悖而入者，亦悖而出。《康誥》曰：「惟命不于常！」道善則得之，不善則失之矣。楚書曰：「楚國無以為寶，惟善以為寶。」舅犯曰：「亡人無以為寶，仁親以為寶。」
 
-   The Book of Songs says:
-   {:.indent-2}"Before Yin lost its armies, it was able to align with the Supreme Deity. Its conduct was a model for all, and its lofty mandate was unchanging."
-   The Way is this: If one gains the people, one gains the state; if one loses the people, one loses the state.
-   
-   Therefore, the gentleman first carefully cultivates virtue. With virtue, one gains the people; with the people, one gains land; with land, one gains wealth; with wealth, one gains resources for use.
-   Virtue is the root, while wealth is the branch. If one values the branches and neglects the root, the people will suffer exploitation.
-   Thus, when wealth is hoarded, the people scatter. 
-   When wealth is distributed, the people gather.
-   Therefore, words spoken deceitfully will return with deceit, wealth obtained unjustly will leave in the same way.
-   
-   The Kang Gao says:
-   {:.indent-2}"The mandate is not constant!"
-   If the Way is good, it is obtained; if it is not good, it is lost.
-   
-   The Book of Chu says:
-   {:.indent-2}"The state of Chu has no treasure; virtue itself is their treasure."
-   
-   Jiu Fan said:
-   {:.indent-2}"The exiled have no treasure; their only treasure is benevolence and close kinship."
{:.verse}

### **14**
《秦誓》曰：「若有一个臣，斷斷兮無他技，其心休休焉，其如有容焉。人之有技，若己有之；人之彥聖，其心好之，不啻若自其口出。實能容之，以能保我子孫黎民，尚亦有利哉！人之有技，媢嫉以惡之；人之彥聖，而違之俾不通。實不能容，以不能保我子孫黎民，亦曰殆哉！」唯仁人放流之，迸諸四夷，不與同中國，此謂唯仁人為能愛人，能惡人。見賢而不能舉，舉而不能先，命也；見不善而不能退，退而不能遠，過也。好人之所惡，惡人之所好，是謂拂人之性，災必逮夫身。是故君子有大道，必忠信以得之，驕泰以失之。

-   The Qin Oath says:
-   {:.indent-2}"If there is a minister who is utterly sincere yet possesses no special skill, whose heart is peaceful and accepting, and accommodating in nature; 
-   
-   If he treats the skills of others as if they were his own, if he admires and delights in the talents and wisdom of others as if such praise had come from his own mouth, then he is truly able to embrace others. 
-   
-   Such a person can preserve the descendants, common people, and the land—how beneficial this would be!
-   But if someone envies and dislikes the skills of others, if they reject and obstruct the talented and wise, making them unable to achieve success, then they are incapable of embracing others. 
-   
-   Such a person cannot protect the descendants, common people, and the land—how dangerous this would be!"
-   Only the virtuous are capable of casting out such people, driving them away to the distant barbarian lands, and refusing to allow them to remain in civilization. This is because only the virtuous can both love and hate appropriately.
-   To see the virtuous and fail to promote them, or to promote them but not prioritize them is a failure of duty. To see wrongdoing and fail to correct it, or to correct it but not remove it entirely is a fatal error.
-   To love what others hate and to hate what others love is to act against human nature, and this behavior will surely bring disaster upon oneself.
-   Therefore, a gentleman who follows the Great Dao must succeed through loyalty and trustworthiness but will fail through arrogance and indulgence."
{:.verse}

### **15**
生財有大道。生之者眾，食之者寡，為之者疾，用之者舒，則財恒足矣。仁者以財發身，不仁者以身發財。未有上好仁而下不好義者也，未有好義其事不終者也，未有府庫財非其財者也。

-   There is a great way for generating wealth:
-   If many contribute to the production of it, but few consume it;
-   If it is created quickly, but it is used sparingly and wisely,
-   Then wealth will always be sufficient.
-   The virtuous use wealth to enhance their own character,
-   While the unvirtuous exhaust themselves to accumulate wealth.
-      
-   There has never been a case where those above value benevolence and those below do not value righteousness.
-   There has never been a case where those who value righteousness fail to see their endeavors through to completion.
-   And there has never been a treasury filled with wealth that does not rightfully belong there.
{:.verse}

孟獻子曰：「畜馬乘，不察於雞豚；伐冰之家，不畜牛羊；百乘之家，不畜聚斂之臣。與其有聚斂之臣，寧有盜臣。」此謂國不以利為利，以義為利也。長國家而務財用者，必自小人矣。彼為善之，小人之使為國家，災害并至。雖有善者，亦無如之何矣！此謂國不以利為利，以義為利也。

-   Meng Xianzi said:
-   {:.indent-2}"A household that keeps horses for carriages does not concern itself with chickens and pigs.
-   {:.indent-2}A household that cuts ice does not keep cattle or sheep.
-   {:.indent-2}A household with a hundred chariots does not employ ministers who focus on hoarding wealth.
-   {:.indent-2}Better to have ministers who are thieves than those who amass wealth through extortion."
-   This means that a nation does not regard profit for the sake of profit, but rather regards righteousness as profit itself.
-   When those who govern a nation prioritize financial gain and material wealth, they are surely following the ways of small people.
-   
-   Even if such individuals perform their duties well, when small people are entrusted with the management of the state, disasters and calamities will inevitably come about.
-   Even if there are virtuous individuals present, they will be powerless to change the situation.
-   This is what is meant by: "A nation does not regard profit for the sake of profit, but regards righteousness profit itself."
