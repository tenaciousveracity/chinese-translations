### **1** The Dao
道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名。无名天地之始；有名万物之母。故常无欲，以观其妙；常有欲，以观其徼。此两者，同出而异名，同谓之玄。玄之又玄，衆妙之门。

-   The Dao that is possibly the Dao is not the everlasting Dao.
-   A name that can be named is not the everlasting name.
-   Nameless since the beginning Heaven and Earth;
-   Named “Mother” by all that exists.
-   Thus eliminating desire it beholds you its glory,
-   Desiring for it, beholds you its boundaries.
-   These two aspects, together form the mystery.
-   A mystery within a mystery, the door to the Universal Truth.
{:.verse}

### **2** Comparisons
天下皆知美之为美，斯恶已。皆知善之为善，斯不善已。故有无相生，难易相成，长短相较，高下相倾，音声相和，前后相随。是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教；万物作焉而不辞，生而不有。为而不恃，功成而弗居。夫唯弗居，是以不去。

>-   Under Heaven, all know beauty from the beautiful, and likewise with ugly. 
>-   All know good from the virtuous, and likewise with wickedness. 
>-   Therefore, existence and non-existence give rise to each other,
>-   Difficultness and easiness complement each other, 
>-   Long and short give rise to comparisons,
>-   Highs and lows turn into each other, 
>-   Voice and sound harmonize one another,
>-   Front and back follow one another.
>-   
>-   Thus, the Sage lives in the state of Wu Wei in matters, conducting no speech and no teachings;
>-   All things come into creation never departing, living and not living. 
>-   Acting and no reliance, success will not reside. 
>-   Thus by not dwelling, it never departs.

### **3** Wu Wei
不尚贤，使民不争；不贵难得之货，使民不为盗；不见可欲，使心不乱。是以圣人之治，虚其心，实其腹，弱其志，强其骨。常使民无知无欲。使夫知者不敢为也。为无为，则无不治。

-   Not esteeming the talented prevents strife among people;
-   Not hoarding valuable goods prevents thievery among people;
-   Not seeing desires and temptations prevents hearts from confusion.
-   Thus a Sage governs by emptying desires, filling bellies, weakening ambitions, and strengthening bones.
-   
-   Continuously empty people’s desires so that schemers dare not act. 
-   Act in accordance with Wu Wei and nothing will be ungoverned. 
{:.verse}

### **4** Ancestor
道冲而用之或不盈。渊兮似万物之宗。挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘。湛兮似或存。吾不知谁之子，象帝之先。

-   The Dao rushes out, used but never emptied.
-   How profound, all things appear to take after it.
-   
-   Dampen the sharpness,
-   Separate out the confusion,
-   Likewise with brightness
-   Along with dust.
-    
-   Deep within, it seems to exists.
-   I do not know who’s offspring it is,
-   Appearing as the ancestor of all things.
{:.verse}

### **5** Straw Dogs
天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；圣人不仁，以百姓为刍狗。天地之间，其犹橐龠乎？虚而不屈，动而愈出。多言数穷，不如守中。

-   Heaven and Earth are not benevolent, 
-   because to them all things are like sacrificial offerings;
-   The Sage is not benevolent,
-   likewise seeing common people as straw dogs.
-   
-   The space between Heaven and Earth,
-   is it not like a bellow, blowing in and out?
-   The more it moves, the more comes out.
-   The more words said, the less they matter,
-   Not as good as holding the Center.
{:.verse}

### **6** Valley Spirit
谷神不死，是谓玄牝。玄牝之门，是谓天地根。绵绵若存，用之不勤。

-   The Valley Spirit never dies, it is called the mystic Anima.
-   The mystic Anima is a door, said to called Heaven and Earth’s root.
-   Continuous and unbroken as it builds up, using it requires no labor.
{:.verse}

### **7** Timelessness
天長地久。天地所以能長且久者，以其不自生，故能長生。是以聖人後其身而身先；外其身而身存。非以其無私耶？故能成其私。

-   Heaven is expansive and Earth is timeless.
-   The reason for Heaven and Earth’s timelessness,
-   is because they do live not for themselves,
-   and thus they can live for a long time.
-   
-   Likewise with the Sage’s body, front and back;
-   they give up their whole form and existence.
-   
-   Is that not selflessness? Thus, their goals will be accomplished.
{:.verse}

### **8** Timelessness
上善若水。水善利萬物而不爭，處衆人之所惡，故幾於道。居善地，心善淵，與善仁，言善信，正善治，事善能，動善時。夫唯不爭，故無尤。

-   The highest good is like water.
-   Water’s goodness benefits all those exist without complaining,
-   residing where everyone deems evil,
-   thus it is close to the Dao.
-   
-   Live virtuously on Earth,
-   Heart of honor and benevolence,
-   Speak justly and truly,
-   Govern duly and rightfully,
-   Handle matters capably,
-   Act virtuously in due time.
-   There will be no contention, therefore no faults.
{:.verse}

### **9** Gold and Jade
持而盈之，不如其已；揣而銳之，不可長保。金玉滿堂，莫之能守；富貴而驕，自遺其咎。功遂身退天之道。

-   Grasping something that is full is not as good as when it’s empty;
-   Counting acutely, you cannot keep the tally for long.
-   Overbrimmed with gold and jade, makes it impossible to safeguard.
-   
-   Riches and pride leads one to misfortune.
-   When work is done and accomplished, achievements return to Heaven, back to the Dao.
{:.verse}

### **10** Profound Virtue
載營魄抱一，能無離乎？專氣致柔，能嬰兒乎？滌除玄覽，能無疵乎？愛民治國，能無知乎？天門開闔，能為雌乎？明白四達，能無知乎？生之、畜之，生而不有，為而不恃，長而不宰，是謂玄德。

-   Carrying a spirit, embracing the One,
-   who is able to remain undivided?
-   
-   By solely focusing on Qi, yields softness,
-   not unlike a baby infant? 
-   
-   Getting rid of one’s deceitful appearances,
-   who will be the one with flaw?
-   
-   Loving and ruling a country,
-   who can be called ignorant?
-   
-   Able to opening and close Heaven’s door,
-   is that not the Feminine power?
-   
-   Reaching for all four directions,
-   who is the one without knowledge?
-   
-   To give birth, 
-   to nurture, 
-   to create and not claim ownership,
-   acting without presumptions, 
-   leading without dominance,
-   This is called the Profound Virtue (Xuan De).
{:.verse}

### **11** Nothingness
三十輻，共一轂，當其無，有車之用。埏埴以為器，當其無，有器之用。鑿戶牖以為室，當其無，有室之用。故有之以為利，無之以為用。

-   Thirty spokes come together to form one wheel, fitting into nothingness, makes the car usable.
-   Mud and clay form a container, having nothing inside, makes it useful.
-   
-   Chiseling windows and doors for a room,
-   both containing nothing, yet provide use for the room.
-   
-   Thus, having determines benefits,
-   Nothingness defines usefulness.
{:.verse}

### **12** Nothingness
五色令人目盲；五音令人耳聾；五味令人口爽；馳騁田獵，令人心發狂；難得之貨，令人行妨。是以聖人為腹不為目，故去彼取此。

-   Five colors leads to blindness,
-   Five notes leads to deafness,
-   Five flavors leads to muted taste.
-   
-   Rushing headfirst to kill leads hearts to madness,
-   Difficult to acquire goods leads people to disaster.
-   
-   Thus the Sage, cares about the belly and not what the eyes see,
-   Giving up the latter, and taking the former. 
{:.verse}

### **13** No Self
寵辱若驚，貴大患若身。何謂寵辱若驚？寵為下，得之若驚，失之若驚，是謂寵辱若驚。何謂貴大患若身？吾所以有大患者，為吾有身，及吾無身，吾有何患？故貴以身為天下，若可寄天下；愛以身為天下，若可託天下。

-   To be honored or disgraced brings fear,
-   high prestige bring harm to the body.
-   
-   What do I mean by honor and disgrace bringing fear?
-   Gaining honors means there will be fear,
-   because losing favor is fearful,
-   So we can say honor and disgrace carries alarms.
-   
-   What does it mean for high prestige bringing harm one’s self?
-   I suffer because I have a self.
-   
-   Therefore, if I have no self, what troubles do I have?
-   
-   Hence by cherishing the body as part of the World, I can entrust World;
-   Loving the body under as part of the World, I can be relied to care for the World.
{:.verse}

### **14** Following the Dao
視之不見，名曰夷；聽之不聞，名曰希；搏之不得，名曰微。此三者不可致詰，故混而為一。其上不皦，其下不昧。繩繩不可名，復歸於無物。是謂無狀之狀，無物之象，是謂惚恍。迎之不見其首，隨之不見其後。執古之道，以御今之有。能知古始，是謂道紀。

-   Looking at it we cannot see it, calling it smooth;
-   Listening to it we cannot hear it, calling it faint;
-   Seizing for we cannot grab it, calling it abstruse. 
-   
-   These three aspects cannot define it,
-   thus combine them to become One.
-   
-   From above, it’s not so bright,
-   from below, it’s not so dark.
-   Threads entwined that have no name,
-   returning back to Wu Wei.
-   
-   It is said to have no form, 
-   the appearance of nothing,
-   as if a hazy dream.
-   
-   Approaching it, you will not see its head,
-   Following it, you will not see its back.
-   
-   Grasp the ancient ways of the Dao,
-   Use it to safeguard the present.
-   
-   Being aware of the primordial, this is called following the Dao
{:.verse}

### **15** The Ancient Masters
古之善為士者，微妙玄通，深不可識。夫唯不可識，故強為之容。豫兮若冬涉川；猶兮若畏四鄰；儼兮其若容；渙兮若冰之將釋；敦兮其若樸；曠兮其若谷；混兮其若濁；孰能濁以靜之徐清？孰能安以久動之徐生？保此道者，不欲盈。夫唯不盈，故能蔽不新成。

-   The ancient masters of virtue were subtle, mysterious, and connected,
-   their depths cannot be recorded,
-   Hence they cannot be described, but I will make an effort to do so.
-   
-   How cautious, as if crossing a river during 2inter;
-   How alert, as if wary of their entire surroundings.
-   
-   How respectful, as if reverent;
-   How fluid, as if ice dissipating,
-   How simple, as if unworked wood;
-   How vast, as if a valley;
-   How turbid, as if muddy water.
-   
-   Who can remain still while the turbidity slowly clears?
-   Who can be peaceful for a long time, living gently?
-   
-   Protecting these endeavors is the road to Dao, not desiring excesses.  
-   Thus, not seeking excesses, they are able to avoid having to change to succeed.
{:.verse}

### **16** Roots
致虛極，守靜篤。萬物並作，吾以觀復。夫物芸芸，各復歸其根。歸根曰靜，是謂復命。復命曰常，知常曰明。不知常，妄作凶。知常容，容乃公，公乃王，王乃天，天乃道，道乃久，沒身不殆。

-   Exemplify emptiness to the utmost, 
-   maintain stillness in earnest.
-   
-   All things and all matter, I’ve watched them come and go. 
-   All of mankind, each of us returning back to our roots.
-   
-   Returning to one’s root is to remain still.
-   We can call this one’s life.
-   
-   Answering one’s own life, you can speak wisely.
-   Not always knowing, but acting with spontaneity.
-   Maintain the appearance,
-   of appearing noble,
-   A noble to a king, a king to Heaven, the Heaven to Dao, the Dao to the Infinite. 
-   The ending of one’s body is not perilous. 
{:.verse}

### **17** High-pedestals 
太上，下知有之；其次，親而譽之；其次，畏之；其次，侮之。信不足，焉有不信焉。悠兮，其貴言。功成事遂，百姓皆謂我自然。

-   The highest above are recognized by those under them,
-   Afterwards, they are favored and praised,
-   Next, they are feared,
-   Finally, they are ridiculed.
-   
-   Where there’s not enough faith, how can there be trust?
-   Drawn out are words of praise.
-   
-   When work is done and completed, everyone will naturally say “I did it”. 
{:.verse}

### **18** Chaos and Union
大道廢，有仁義；智慧出，有大偽；六親不和，有孝慈；國家昏亂，有忠臣。

-   When the great Dao is forgotten, there is benevolence and righteousness;
-   Wisdom comes out, though contains great falsities;
-   
-   Six relations who do not get along, will find union and compassion;
-   A nation in chaos, brings about faithful protectors.
{:.verse}

### **19** Simplicity
絕聖棄智，民利百倍；絕仁棄義，民復孝慈；絕巧棄利，盜賊無有。此三者以為文不足。故令有所屬：見素抱樸，少私寡欲。

-   Renouncing paragons, relinquishing wisdom benefits countrymen a hundred fold.
-   Renouncing humaneness, abandoning righteousness, brings countrymen back to filial piety and compassion.
-   Renouncing opportunities, relinquishing interests, vacates bandits and thieves.
-   
-   These three ideas cannot be conveyed with words alone.
-   So, lead your subordinates by meeting them unadorned, exemplifying simplicity,
-   lacking selfishness and dispersing desires.
{:.verse}

### **20** Unmoved
絕學無憂，唯之與阿，相去幾何？善之與惡，相去若何？人之所畏，不可不畏。荒兮其未央哉！衆人熙熙，如享太牢，如春登臺。我獨怕兮其未兆；如嬰兒之未孩；儽儽兮若無所歸。衆人皆有餘，而我獨若遺。我愚人之心也哉！沌沌兮，俗人昭昭，我獨若昏。俗人察察，我獨悶悶。澹兮其若海，飂兮若無止，衆人皆有以，而我獨頑似鄙。我獨異於人，而貴食母。

-   Ceasing one’s studies is to be without worries,
-   alone in the moment, how many times do appearances change? 
-   
-   Good and evil, appear to turn into each other?
-   That which people fear, we must not be afraid.
-   
-   It seems desolate and never ending!
-   Everyone is splendidly prosperous, as if enjoying offerings like they were Gods, as if youths ascending high.
-   
-   I alone am afraid, lacking a future.
-   Seemingly like a baby, not yet a child.
-   
-   Tired and worn out, not having anywhere to belong.
-   The majority have abundances, which I alone leave behind.
-   
-   I’m an ignorant person, with a heart that’s similar. 
-   
-   When chaos and turbulence erupts,
-   Others sprout up to shine, I alone am muddle-headed.
-   Commoners go inquire and inspect,
-   I alone, seal myself tight.
-   
-   Tranquil, ah, like the sea.
-   
-   Winds in high places, seem to keep blowing,
-   Moving bodies about, but I alone am stubborn and unmoved. 
-   
-   I alone am different to others,
-   graciously nourished by Mother Earth.
{:.verse}

### **21** essence
孔德之容，唯道是從。道之為物，唯恍唯惚。忽兮恍兮，其中有象；恍兮忽兮，其中有物。窈兮冥兮，其中有精；其精甚真，其中有信。自古及今，其名不去，以閱衆甫。吾何以知衆甫之狀哉？以此。

-   Contain the virtue of emptiness, be alone with the Dao.
-   The Dao exists, it’s flurried and indistinct.
-   
-   Hazily, suddenly, among it takes form,
-   Profoundly, deeply, therein lies the essence.
-   
-   The genuine, overwhelming essence,
-   wherein there is trust.
-   
-   From ancient times to now, its name remains. 
-   How do I know it’s form?
-   
-   Because of this.
{:.verse}

### **22** Following
曲則全，枉則直，窪則盈，弊則新，少則得，多則惑。是以聖人抱一為天下式。不自見，故明；不自是，故彰；不自伐，故有功；不自矜，故長。夫唯不爭，故天下莫能與之爭。古之所謂曲則全者，豈虛言哉！誠全而歸之。

-   Brokenness follows completeness,
-   crookedness follows straightness,
-   depletion follows excesses,
-   counterfeits follows progress.
-   
-   Losing follows obtaining,
-   Too many norms leads to confusion.
-   
-   Therefore, the Sage, serves to act in accordance with Heaven.
-   Not seeing themselves as being bright,
-   Not conspicuous to oneself,
-   Not self-boasting, leading to achievements.
-   Not blowing one’s horn, therefore lasting. 
-   
-   Not fighting the work to be done, hence, there is none under Heaven who can argue.
-   The Ancients said ‘brokenness follows completeness’, what empty words!
-   When the process completes, it returns back.
{:.verse}

### **23** Faith
希言自然，故飄風不終朝，驟雨不終日。孰為此者？天地。天地尚不能久，而況於人乎？故從事於道者，道者，同於道；德者，同於德；失者，同於失。同於道者，道亦樂得之；同於德者，德亦樂得之；同於失者，失亦樂得之。信不足，焉有不信焉。

-   Hopeful words are natural,
-   Stormy winds do not last all morning,
-   Showers do not last all day.
-   
-   What causes these to end?
-   
-   Heaven and Earth.
-   Heaven and Earth cannot keep either going for long,
-   and with human affairs, is that not that same?
-   
-   Therefore, those who undertake the Dao are akin with the Dao,
-   Those who are virtuous are akin with virtue,
-   Those who are lacking are akin to failure,
-   
-   When practicing Daoism, the Dao is happily obtained,
-When practicing virtuosity, virtues are happily obtained.
-   When lacking, failure is happily obtained.
-   
-   If there is not enough faith, how can there be trust?
{:.verse}

### **24** Excesses
企者不立；跨者不行；自見者不明；自是者不彰；自伐者無功；自矜者不長。其在道也，曰：餘食贅行。物或惡之，故有道者不處。

-   Striving upward, unable to stand;
-   Straddling long, unable to walk;
-   Seeing oneself, unable to understand;
-   Defining oneself, unable to be clear;
-   Self-denigrating oneself, unable to succeed;
-   Boasting oneself, unable to last.
-   
-   To be with the Dao, is to say:
-   “Too much food and unneeded excesses”
-   
-   These things might bring harm,
-   Thus having the Dao means not dwelling.
{:.verse}

### **25** Vast
有物混成，先天地生。寂兮寥兮，獨立不改，周行而不殆，可以為天下母。吾不知其名，字之曰道，強為之名曰大。大曰逝，逝曰遠，遠曰反。故道大，天大，地大，王亦大。域中有四大，而王居其一焉。人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然。

-   Containing all matter mixed completely, before the Universe was born.
-   How Silent! How Lonesome!
-   Alone and non-changing,
-   Perfectly complete, never dying,
-   Able to do so because it is the Earth’s mother. 
-   
-   I do not know its name. 
-   The word we use is ‘Dao’
-   With some thought, I call it Vast.
-   
-   Vast meaning it passes by, 
-   Passes by, it is distant,
-   at a distance, it is said to be returning.
-   
-   Thus the ‘Dao’ is Vast, Heaven is Vast, Earth is Vast, the King is also Vast. 
-   The land we live on has these four ‘Vasts’, where the King resides. 
-   
-   People follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Dao, Dao follows Zi Ran (it's nature). 
{:.verse}

### **26** Heaviness
重為輕根，靜為躁君。是以聖人終日行不離輜重。雖有榮觀，燕處超然。奈何萬乘之主，而以身輕天下？輕則失本，躁則失君。

-   Heaviness acts as the root for lightness,
-   Calmness acts as the master of impatience.
-   
-   Thus, the Sage travels all day, without leaving his heavy supplies.
-   Though surrounded by glorious things to see, they remain aloof in the Kingdom.
-   
-   How can their body be so light under Heaven?
-   Lightness leads to one losing their roots.
-   Hot-headedness leads to one’s demise. 
{:.verse}

### **27** Spreading Enlightenment
善行無轍迹，善言無瑕讁；善數不用籌策；善閉無關楗而不可開，善結無繩約而不可解。是以聖人常善救人，故無棄人；常善救物，故無棄物。是謂襲明。故善人者，不善人之師；不善人者，善人之資。不貴其師，不愛其資，雖智大迷，是謂要妙。

-   Good deeds leave no traces,
-   Good words are without flaws,
-   Good counters need no tallies,
-   Good gates have no bars yet cannot be opened,
-   Good binds have no knotted ropes yet cannot be loosened.
-   
-   Thus, the Sage, is always good, saving others, hence, not abandoning others.
-   Always good, rescuing all things, hence, not abandoning anything.
-   
-   This can be called “Spreading Enlightnement.
-   Good people become not-so-good people’s teacher.
-   Not-so-good people become good people’s support.
-   
-   If the teacher is not valued, or the student unloved,
-   Results in great wisdom that is lost, we call this wanting to be clever.  
{:.verse}

### **28** Simplicity
知其雄，守其雌，為天下谿。為天下谿，常德不離，復歸於嬰兒。知其白，守其黑，為天下式。為天下式，常德不忒，復歸於無極。知其榮，守其辱，為天下谷。為天下谷，常德乃足，復歸於樸。樸散則為器，聖人用之，則為官長，故大制不割。

-   Knowing the masculine,
-   Guarding the feminine,
-   Serving like a stream under Heaven.
-   
-   Serving as a stream under Heaven, always virtuous, never leaving, returning to infanthood.
-   Know the White, guard the Black, taking form under heaven,
-   Always virtuous, not erring, returning back to the eternal.
-   
-   Know honor, guard dishonor, serve as the Valley under Heaven.
-   Act as the Valley under Heaven, always overbrimming with virtuosity, and returning to simplicity.
-   
-   Simplicity is a tool the Sage uses to officiate to not cut apart great machinations.
{:.verse}

### **29** Heavenly Machinations
將欲取天下而為之，吾見其不得已。天下神器，不可為也，為者敗之，執者失之。故物或行或隨；或歔或吹；或強或羸；或挫或隳。是以聖人去甚，去奢，去泰。

-   Anyone wishing to lead and conquer, I see that it will not work.
-   Heavenly’s machinations will not allow it, ambition turns to defeat, execution turns to failure.
-   
-   Because all things may or may not follow;
-   They may snort or they may puff;
-   They may be strong or they may be weak;
-   They might be suppressed or they might overpower.
-   
-   Thus, the Sage dismisses excesses, dismisses extravagance, dismisses grandeur. 
{:.verse}

### **30** Troops and Thistles
以道佐人主者，不以兵強天下。其事好還。師之所處，荊棘生焉。大軍之後，必有凶年。善有果而已，不敢以取強。果而勿矜，果而勿伐，果而勿驕。果而不得已，果而勿強。物壯則老，是謂不道，不道早已。

-   A ruler advised by the Dao, does not employ strong forces under Heaven,
-   resulting in good outcomes in all matters.
-   
-   Where troops reside, thistles and thorns are born.
-   Amassing big armies, famine will certainly follow. 
-   
-   The Good acquires results and stops, not daring to take more,
-   not boasting, 
-   not downplaying, 
-   not arrogant.
-  
-   Do not force results. 
-   Strengthening things, oldens them.
-   This is not the way of the Dao.
-   Not the way of the Dao means an early end. 
{:.verse}

### **31** Left and Right
夫佳兵者，不祥之器，物或惡之，故有道者不處。君子居則貴左，用兵則貴右。兵者不祥之器，非君子之器，不得已而用之，恬淡為上。勝而不美，而美之者，是樂殺人。夫樂殺人者，則不可以得志於天下矣。吉事尚左，凶事尚右。偏將軍居左，上將軍居右，言以喪禮處之。殺人之衆，以哀悲泣之，戰勝以喪禮處之。

-   Fine adept soldiers are not an auspicious a tool and perhaps an omen, 
-   Therefore those following the Dao, do not use them.
-   The Noble stand still, honoring the Left, 
-   when employing troops, honor the Right.
-   
-   Military force is an ominous tool, the Noble do not employ.
-   It is used as a last resort, tranquility and peace is best.
-   
-   Victory is not beautiful, for its’ beauty involves delight in slaughter.
-   People who happily slaughter will have their ambitions cut short under Heaven.
-   
-   In auspicious matters, employ the Left,
-   In violent matters, employ the Right.
-   The army’s deputy general resides on the Left,
-   The commander-in-chief resides on the Right, leading mourning rites for the dead.
-   
-   Mass killing leads to sorrow, sadness, and sobbing.
-   Winning a war means dealing with funerals.

### **32** Almighty
道常無名。樸雖小，天下莫能臣也。侯王若能守之，萬物將自賓。天地相合，以降甘露，民莫之令而自均。始制有名，名亦既有，夫亦將知止，知止所以不殆。譬道之在天下，猶川谷之與江海。

-   The Dao is forever nameless.
-   Even though plain and miniscule, there is none under Heaven who can serve it.
-   
-   If high official and kings are able to maintain it,
-   all things will act as their natural guests.
-   
-   Heaven and Earth fit together, dripping sweet nectar,
-   Commanding no one, thus there is natural equanimity.
-   
-   Creating systems, defining labels,
-   even though the name is already there,
-   yet men desire to know more and more,
-   to stop one’s knowledge is not dangerous.
-   
-   Just like the Dao existing under Heaven,
-   As if a creek, as if a valley, taking part in the river and oceans.
{:.verse}

### **33** Know Thyself
知人者智，自知者明。勝人者有力，自勝者強。知足者富。強行者有志。不失其所者久。死而不亡者壽。

-   Knowing others is to be wise, knowing oneself is to be enlightened.
-   Defeating others uses effort, defeating oneself yields strength.
-   
-   Content with one’s situation is to be fortunate.
-   
-   Unyielding, having willpower.
-   Not losing one’s place for a long time.
-   Dead, but not forgotten, thereby living long. 
{:.verse}

### **34** Greatness
大道汎兮，其可左右。萬物恃之而生而不辭，功成不名有。衣養萬物而不為主，常無欲，可名於小；萬物歸焉，而不為主，可名為大。以其終不自為大，故能成其大。

-   Ah, how the Great Dao spreads,
-   found on the left and right.
-   All things rely on it, born from it, yet never leaves it.
-   Enrobing, supporting all things but not commanding.
-   
-   Always desireless, we can call it tiny;
-   All things return back to it, but doesn't act as their lord.
-   
-   It can be called Great.
-   In the end, it does not think itself as Great, 
-   thereby, able to turn into Greatness.
{:.verse}

### **35** Invitation
執大象，天下往。往而不害，安平大。樂與餌，過客止。道之出口，淡乎其無味，視之不足見，聽之不足聞，用之不足既。

-   Grasping the Great form, all under Heaven will come.
-   Directing no harm, but greatly calming and soothing.
-   With music and pastries, passing travelers stop by.
-   
-   The Dao outpouring is mild and tasteless;
-   Looking for it, is not enough to see it.
-   Listening for it, is not enough to hear it.
-   Employing it, is not enough to empty it. 
{:.verse}

### **36** Profound Truth
將欲歙之，必固張之；將欲弱之，必固強之；將欲廢之，必固興之；將欲奪之，必固與之。是謂微明。柔弱勝剛強。魚不可脫於淵，國之利器不可以示人。

-   Willing to contain desires, you must undoubtedly spread them;
-   Willing to weaken desires, you must undoubtedly strengthen them;
-   Willing to abolish desires, you must undoubtedly flourish them;
-   Willing to seize desires, you must undoubtedly let them go.
-   
-   This can be called, the ‘Profound Truth’
-   The soft and weak prevailing over the hard and strong.
-   
-   Fish cannot escape deep ponds,
-   A country’s sharp weapons must not be displayed to people.
{:.verse}

### **37** Simplicity
道常無為而無不為。侯王若能守之，萬物將自化。化而欲作，吾將鎮之以無名之樸。無名之樸，夫亦將無欲。不欲以靜，天下將自定。

-   The Dao is always in the state of Wu Wei, hence there is nothing not done. 
-   If nobles and kings are able to abide by the Dao,
-   all things will, as a matter of course, change.
-   
-   When changes and desires arise,
-   I calm them down with a simplicity that’s nameless.
-   
-   Nameless simplicity disperses men’s desires.
-   By not desiring and remaining calm, all things under Heaven will settle.
