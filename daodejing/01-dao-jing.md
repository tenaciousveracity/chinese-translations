### **1** The Dao
道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名。无名天地之始；有名万物之母。故常无欲，以观其妙；常有欲，以观其徼。此两者，同出而异名，同谓之玄。玄之又玄，衆妙之门。

-   The Dao that is possibly the Dao is not the everlasting Dao.
-   A name that can be named is not the everlasting name.
-   Nameless since the beginning Heaven and Earth;
-   Named “Mother” by all that exists.
-   Thus eliminating desire it beholds you its glory,
-   Desiring for it, beholds you its boundaries.
-   These two aspects, together form the mystery.
-   A mystery within a mystery, the door to the Universal Truth.
{:.verse}

### **2** Comparisons
天下皆知美之为美，斯恶已。皆知善之为善，斯不善已。故有无相生，难易相成，长短相较，高下相倾，音声相和，前后相随。是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教；万物作焉而不辞，生而不有。为而不恃，功成而弗居。夫唯弗居，是以不去。

>-   Under Heaven, all know beauty from the beautiful, and likewise with ugly. 
>-   All know good from the virtuous, and likewise with wickedness. 
>-   Therefore, existence and non-existence give rise to each other,
>-   Difficultness and easiness complement each other, 
>-   Long and short give rise to comparisons,
>-   Highs and lows turn into each other, 
>-   Voice and sound harmonize one another,
>-   Front and back follow one another.
>-   
>-   Thus, the Sage lives in the state of Wu Wei in matters, conducting no speech and no teachings;
>-   All things come into creation never departing, living and not living. 
>-   Acting and no reliance, success will not reside. 
>-   Thus by not dwelling, it never departs.

### **3** Wu Wei
不尚贤，使民不争；不贵难得之货，使民不为盗；不见可欲，使心不乱。是以圣人之治，虚其心，实其腹，弱其志，强其骨。常使民无知无欲。使夫知者不敢为也。为无为，则无不治。

-   Not esteeming the talented prevents strife among people;
-   Not hoarding valuable goods prevents thievery among people;
-   Not seeing desires and temptations prevents hearts from confusion.
-   Thus a Sage governs by emptying desires, filling bellies, weakening ambitions, and strengthening bones.
-   
-   Continuously empty people’s desires so that schemers dare not act. 
-   Act in accordance with Wu Wei and nothing will be ungoverned. 
{:.verse}

### **4** Ancestor
道冲而用之或不盈。渊兮似万物之宗。挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘。湛兮似或存。吾不知谁之子，象帝之先。

-   The Dao rushes out, used but never emptied.
-   How profound, all things appear to take after it.
-   
-   Dampen the sharpness,
-   Separate out the confusion,
-   Likewise with brightness
-   Along with dust.
-    
-   Deep within, it seems to exists.
-   I do not know who’s offspring it is,
-   Appearing as the ancestor of all things.
{:.verse}

### **5** Straw Dogs
天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；圣人不仁，以百姓为刍狗。天地之间，其犹橐龠乎？虚而不屈，动而愈出。多言数穷，不如守中。

-   Heaven and Earth are not benevolent, 
-   because to them all things are like sacrificial offerings;
-   The Sage is not benevolent,
-   likewise seeing common people as straw dogs.
-   
-   The space between Heaven and Earth,
-   is it not like a bellow, blowing in and out?
-   The more it moves, the more comes out.
-   The more words said, the less they matter,
-   Not as good as holding the Center.
{:.verse}

### **6** Valley Spirit
谷神不死，是谓玄牝。玄牝之门，是谓天地根。绵绵若存，用之不勤。

-   The Valley Spirit never dies, it is called the mystic Anima.
-   The mystic Anima is a door, said to called Heaven and Earth’s root.
-   Continuous and unbroken as it builds up, using it requires no labor.
{:.verse}

### **7** Timelessness
天長地久。天地所以能長且久者，以其不自生，故能長生。是以聖人後其身而身先；外其身而身存。非以其無私耶？故能成其私。

-   Heaven is expansive and Earth is timeless.
-   The reason for Heaven and Earth’s timelessness,
-   is because they do live not for themselves,
-   and thus they can live for a long time.
-   
-   Likewise with the Sage’s body, front and back;
-   they give up their whole form and existence.
-   
-   Is that not selflessness? Thus, their goals will be accomplished.
{:.verse}

### **8** Timelessness
上善若水。水善利萬物而不爭，處衆人之所惡，故幾於道。居善地，心善淵，與善仁，言善信，正善治，事善能，動善時。夫唯不爭，故無尤。

-   The highest good is like water.
-   Water’s goodness benefits all those exist without complaining,
-   residing where everyone deems evil,
-   thus it is close to the Dao.
-   
-   Live virtuously on Earth,
-   Heart of honor and benevolence,
-   Speak justly and truly,
-   Govern duly and rightfully,
-   Handle matters capably,
-   Act virtuously in due time.
-   There will be no contention, therefore no faults.
{:.verse}

### **9** Gold and Jade
持而盈之，不如其已；揣而銳之，不可長保。金玉滿堂，莫之能守；富貴而驕，自遺其咎。功遂身退天之道。

-   Grasping something that is full is not as good as when it’s empty;
-   Counting acutely, you cannot keep the tally for long.
-   Overbrimmed with gold and jade, makes it impossible to safeguard.
-   
-   Riches and pride leads one to misfortune.
-   When work is done and accomplished, achievements return to Heaven, back to the Dao.
{:.verse}

### **10** Profound Virtue
載營魄抱一，能無離乎？專氣致柔，能嬰兒乎？滌除玄覽，能無疵乎？愛民治國，能無知乎？天門開闔，能為雌乎？明白四達，能無知乎？生之、畜之，生而不有，為而不恃，長而不宰，是謂玄德。

-   Carrying a spirit, embracing the One,
-   who is able to remain undivided?
-   
-   By solely focusing on Qi, yields softness,
-   not unlike a baby infant? 
-   
-   Getting rid of one’s deceitful appearances,
-   who will be the one with flaw?
-   
-   Loving and ruling a country,
-   who can be called ignorant?
-   
-   Able to opening and close Heaven’s door,
-   is that not the Feminine power?
-   
-   Reaching for all four directions,
-   who is the one without knowledge?
-   
-   To give birth, 
-   to nurture, 
-   to create and not claim ownership,
-   acting without presumptions, 
-   leading without dominance,
-   This is called the Profound Virtue (Xuan De).
{:.verse}

### **11** Nothingness
三十輻，共一轂，當其無，有車之用。埏埴以為器，當其無，有器之用。鑿戶牖以為室，當其無，有室之用。故有之以為利，無之以為用。

-   Thirty spokes come together to form one wheel, fitting into nothingness, makes the car usable.
-   Mud and clay form a container, having nothing inside, makes it useful.
-   
-   Chiseling windows and doors for a room,
-   both containing nothing, yet provide use for the room.
-   
-   Thus, having determines benefits,
-   Nothingness defines usefulness.
{:.verse}

### **12** Nothingness
五色令人目盲；五音令人耳聾；五味令人口爽；馳騁田獵，令人心發狂；難得之貨，令人行妨。是以聖人為腹不為目，故去彼取此。

-   Five colors leads to blindness,
-   Five notes leads to deafness,
-   Five flavors leads to muted taste.
-   
-   Rushing headfirst to kill leads hearts to madness,
-   Difficult to acquire goods leads people to disaster.
-   
-   Thus the Sage, cares about the belly and not what the eyes see,
-   Giving up the latter, and taking the former. 
{:.verse}

### **13** No Self
寵辱若驚，貴大患若身。何謂寵辱若驚？寵為下，得之若驚，失之若驚，是謂寵辱若驚。何謂貴大患若身？吾所以有大患者，為吾有身，及吾無身，吾有何患？故貴以身為天下，若可寄天下；愛以身為天下，若可託天下。

-   To be honored or disgraced brings fear,
-   high prestige bring harm to the body.
-   
-   What do I mean by honor and disgrace bringing fear?
-   Gaining honors means there will be fear,
-   because losing favor is fearful,
-   So we can say honor and disgrace carries alarms.
-   
-   What does it mean for high prestige bringing harm one’s self?
-   I suffer because I have a self.
-   
-   Therefore, if I have no self, what troubles do I have?
-   
-   Hence by cherishing the body as part of the World, I can entrust World;
-   Loving the body under as part of the World, I can be relied to care for the World.
{:.verse}

### **14** Following the Dao
視之不見，名曰夷；聽之不聞，名曰希；搏之不得，名曰微。此三者不可致詰，故混而為一。其上不皦，其下不昧。繩繩不可名，復歸於無物。是謂無狀之狀，無物之象，是謂惚恍。迎之不見其首，隨之不見其後。執古之道，以御今之有。能知古始，是謂道紀。

-   Looking at it we cannot see it, calling it smooth;
-   Listening to it we cannot hear it, calling it faint;
-   Seizing for we cannot grab it, calling it abstruse. 
-   
-   These three aspects cannot define it,
-   thus combine them to become One.
-   
-   From above, it’s not so bright,
-   from below, it’s not so dark.
-   Threads entwined that have no name,
-   returning back to Wu Wei.
-   
-   It is said to have no form, 
-   the appearance of nothing,
-   as if a hazy dream.
-   
-   Approaching it, you will not see its head,
-   Following it, you will not see its back.
-   
-   Grasp the ancient ways of the Dao,
-   Use it to safeguard the present.
-   
-   Being aware of the primordial, this is called following the Dao
{:.verse}

### **15** The Ancient Masters
古之善為士者，微妙玄通，深不可識。夫唯不可識，故強為之容。豫兮若冬涉川；猶兮若畏四鄰；儼兮其若容；渙兮若冰之將釋；敦兮其若樸；曠兮其若谷；混兮其若濁；孰能濁以靜之徐清？孰能安以久動之徐生？保此道者，不欲盈。夫唯不盈，故能蔽不新成。

-   The ancient masters of virtue were subtle, mysterious, and connected,
-   their depths cannot be recorded,
-   Hence they cannot be described, but I will make an effort to do so.
-   
-   How cautious, as if crossing a river during 2inter;
-   How alert, as if wary of their entire surroundings.
-   
-   How respectful, as if reverent;
-   How fluid, as if ice dissipating,
-   How simple, as if unworked wood;
-   How vast, as if a valley;
-   How turbid, as if muddy water.
-   
-   Who can remain still while the turbidity slowly clears?
-   Who can be peaceful for a long time, living gently?
-   
-   Protecting these endeavors is the road to Dao, not desiring excesses.  
-   Thus, not seeking excesses, they are able to avoid having to change to succeed.
{:.verse}

### **16** Roots
致虛極，守靜篤。萬物並作，吾以觀復。夫物芸芸，各復歸其根。歸根曰靜，是謂復命。復命曰常，知常曰明。不知常，妄作凶。知常容，容乃公，公乃王，王乃天，天乃道，道乃久，沒身不殆。

-   Exemplify emptiness to the utmost, 
-   maintain stillness in earnest.
-   
-   All things and all matter, I’ve watched them come and go. 
-   All of mankind, each of us returning back to our roots.
-   
-   Returning to one’s root is to remain still.
-   We can call this one’s life.
-   
-   Answering one’s own life, you can speak wisely.
-   Not always knowing, but acting with spontaneity.
-   Maintain the appearance,
-   of appearing noble,
-   A noble to a king, a king to Heaven, the Heaven to Dao, the Dao to the Infinite. 
-   The ending of one’s body is not perilous. 
{:.verse}
