### **1** The Dao
道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名。无名天地之始；有名万物之母。故常无欲，以观其妙；常有欲，以观其徼。此两者，同出而异名，同谓之玄。玄之又玄，衆妙之门。

-   The Dao that is possibly the Dao is not the everlasting Dao.
-   A name that can be named is not the everlasting name.
-   Nameless since the beginning Heaven and Earth;
-   Named “Mother” by all that exists.
-   Thus eliminating desire it beholds you its glory,
-   Desiring for it, beholds you its boundaries.
-   These two aspects, together form the mystery.
-   A mystery within a mystery, the door to the Universal Truth.

### **2** Comparisons
天下皆知美之为美，斯恶已。皆知善之为善，斯不善已。故有无相生，难易相成，长短相较，高下相倾，音声相和，前后相随。是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教；万物作焉而不辞，生而不有。为而不恃，功成而弗居。夫唯弗居，是以不去。

-   Under Heaven, all know beauty from the beautiful, and likewise with ugly. 
-   All know good from the virtuous, and likewise with wickedness. 
-   Therefore, existence and non-existence give rise to each other,
-   Difficultness and easiness complement each other, 
-   Long and short give rise to comparisons,
-   Highs and lows turn into each other, 
-   Voice and sound harmonize one another,
-   Front and back follow one another.
-   
-   Thus, the Sage lives in the state of Wu Wei in matters, conducting no speech and no teachings;
-   All things come into creation never departing, living and not living. 
-   Acting and no reliance, success will not reside. 
-   Thus by not dwelling, it never departs.
