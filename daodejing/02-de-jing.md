### **38** Acting with Decorum
上德不德，是以有德；下德不失德，是以無德。上德無為而無以為；下德為之而有以為。上仁為之而無以為；上義為之而有以為。上禮為之而莫之應，則攘臂而扔之。故失道而後德，失德而後仁，失仁而後義，失義而後禮。夫禮者，忠信之薄，而亂之首。前識者，道之華，而愚之始。是以大丈夫處其厚，不居其薄；處其實，不居其華。故去彼取此。

-   Under Heaven, all know beauty from the beautiful, and likewise with ugly. 
-   All know good from the virtuous, and likewise with wickedness. 
-   Therefore, existence and non-existence give rise to each other,
-   Difficultness and easiness complement each other, 
-   Long and short give rise to comparisons,
-   Highs and lows turn into each other, 
-   Voice and sound harmonize one another,
-   Front and back follow one another.
-   
-   Thus, the Sage lives in the state of Wu Wei in matters, conducting no speech and no teachings;
-   All things come into creation never departing, living and not living. 
-   Acting and no reliance, success will not reside. 
-   Thus by not dwelling, it never departs.
