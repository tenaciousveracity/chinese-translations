### **38** Acting with Decorum
上德不德，是以有德；下德不失德，是以無德。上德無為而無以為；下德為之而有以為。上仁為之而無以為；上義為之而有以為。上禮為之而莫之應，則攘臂而扔之。故失道而後德，失德而後仁，失仁而後義，失義而後禮。夫禮者，忠信之薄，而亂之首。前識者，道之華，而愚之始。是以大丈夫處其厚，不居其薄；處其實，不居其華。故去彼取此。

-   The most virtuous do not seem virtuous, therefore they have virtues;
-   The least virtuous have no virtues to lose, therefore they lack virtue.
-   The most virtuous engage in Wu Wei and not in thinking;
-   The least virtuous act and hold intentions.
-   
-   The most benevolent acts without thinking;
-   The highest justice acts with thought.
-   The highest decorum is created so that none can follow, then are resisted and thrown away. 
-   
-   Thus losing the Dao leads to virtues,
-   losing virtue leads to benevolence,
-   losing benevolence leads to justice,
-   losing justice leads to decorum.
-   But decorum’s loyalty is thin, its thoughts chaotic.
-   
-   After knowing of the Dao’s superficial glamour, and foolishness’ beginnings.
-   Thus a man of character lives in the profound and not the superficial;
-   Resides in reality, not in glamour. Therefore leaving this and choosing that. 
{:.verse}

### **39** Oneness
昔之得一者：天得一以清；地得一以寧；神得一以靈；谷得一以盈；萬物得一以生；侯王得一以為天下貞。其致之，天無以清，將恐裂；地無以寧，將恐發；神無以靈，將恐歇；谷無以盈，將恐竭；萬物無以生，將恐滅；侯王無以貴高將恐蹶。故貴以賤為本，高以下為基。是以侯王自稱孤、寡、不穀。此非以賤為本耶？非乎？故致數譽無譽。不欲琭琭如玉，珞珞如石。

-   In Ancient times, these were able gain Oneness:
-   Heaven, became one, in order to be pure;
-   Earth, became one, in order to be peaceful;
-   Consciousness, became one, in order to be alert;
-   Valley, became one, in order to be full;
-   All thing, became one, in order to live;
-   Nobles and kings, being one, in order to become chaste under Heaven.
-   
-   Oneness causes it so, 
-   Heaven not being pure, leads fear to render it open;
-   Earth not being peaceful, leads fear to emanate;
-   Spirit not being alert, leads fear to reside;
-   Valley, not being full, leads fear to exhaust;
-   All things not living, leads fear to exterminate;
-   Nobles and Kings lacking noble values, leads fear to trample about;
-   
-   Therefore, nobility is lowly in origin, the high becoming low to serve as the foundation.
-   Thus, kings of nobility claim to be alone, scant, not that deep. 
-   Are these not lowly things to act as the stem? Really?
-   Therefore, conveying numerous acclamations is not to be praised.
-   Not desiring the jade to be jade, but seeing gems in necklaces as stones.
{:.verse}

### **40** Nothingness 
反者道之動；弱者道之用。天下萬物生於有，有生於無。

-   Reversals set the Dao in motion;
-   Weakness employs the Dao.
-   
-   Under Heaven all things are born from it,
-   bringing life from nothingness. 
{:.verse}

### **41** Path of the Dao
上士聞道，勤而行之；中士聞道，若存若亡；下士聞道，大笑之。不笑不足以為道。故建言有之：明道若昧；進道若退；夷道若纇；上德若谷；太白若辱；廣德若不足；建德若偷；質真若渝；大方無隅；大器晚成；大音希聲；大象無形；道隱無名。夫唯道，善貸且成。

-   When the superior scholar hears the Dao, they diligently walks with it;
-   When the middling scholar hears the Dao, they might store it or they might lose it;
-   When the lowly scholar hears the Dao, big laughs come out.
-   
-   If there weren't big laughs, it wouldn't be the Dao.
-   Thus, here are some suggestions:
-   
-   Illuminating on the Dao makes it seem dark;
-   Progress on the Dao seems like regression;
-   Smoothing out the Dao seems to create more knots;
-   The highest goodness seems to be a valley;
-   The greatest purity seems to be impure;
-   Abundances of virtues seem to be insufficient;
-   Establishing one's goodness is akin to stealing;
-   Genuine character seems to be on the contrary;
-   
-   Great squares have no corners;
-   Great machinations take time to succeed;
-   Great sound strive for intonation;
-   Great appearances have no form;
-   
-   The hidden Dao is obscure,
-   yet the Dao lends its Goodness to bring about success.
{:.verse}

### **42** Aloneness
道生一，一生二，二生三，三生萬物。萬物負陰而抱陽，沖氣以為和。人之所惡，唯孤、寡、不穀，而王公以為稱。故物或損之而益，或益之而損。人之所教，我亦教之。強梁者不得其死，吾將以為教父。

-   The Dao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, three gives birth to all things.
-   
-   All things bear Yin and carry Yang, and by infusing Qi they come together. 
-   People hate to be alone, widowed, not deep, yet kings and nobles self-designate these titles. 
-   
-   Thus, all things might be losing and gaining, or gaining and losing.
-   What people teach, I also teach.
-   "The strong and violent won’t die naturally", 
-   Using this as the seed of my teachings.
{:.verse}

### **43** Wu Wei
天下之至柔，馳騁天下之至堅。無有入無間，吾是以知無為之有益。不言之教，無為之益，天下希及之。

-   Under Heaven the weakest quickly dashes against the strongest under Heaven.
-   Nothingness can enter where there are no gaps,
-   I, therefore, know of Wu Wei’s benefits.
-   Not talking but is teaching,
-   not doing but is beneficial,
-   this is extremely rare under Heaven.
{:.verse}

### **44** Persisting
名與身孰親？身與貨孰多？得與亡孰病？是故甚愛必大費；多藏必厚亡。知足不辱，知止不殆，可以長久。

-   Name or body, which is the self?
-   Body or material wealth, which matters more?
-   To obtain or lose, which one causes ill?
-   
-   Therefore, obsessive love is squandered;
-   Too many possesions leads to suffering heavy losses.
-   
-   To know when one is sufficient is not disgraceful,
-   To know when to stop is not dangerous,
-   this is how to to persist for a long time. 
{:.verse}

### **45** Hot and Cold
大成若缺，其用不弊。大盈若沖，其用不窮。大直若屈，大巧若拙，大辯若訥。躁勝寒靜勝熱。清靜為天下正。

-   Great accomplishments appear incomplete, yet using it does not bring harm.
-   Great fullness seems to be flushed out, yet using it does not exhaust it.
-   Great straightness appear bent, 
-   Great skills appear like awkwardness,
-   Great arguments appear incoherent. 
-   
-   Hot tempers overcome cold,
-   Calmness overcomes heat.
-   Being still and calm is the proper way to serve under Heaven.
{:.verse}

### **46** Horses
天下有道，卻走馬以糞。天下無道，戎馬生於郊。禍莫大於不知足；咎莫大於欲得。故知足之足，常足矣。

-   Under Heaven having the Dao, retreating horses carry manure.
-   Under Heaven when there is no Dao, war horses are born in the outskirts.
-   
-   The greatest calamity is not knowing when enough is enough;
-   The greatest misfortune is desiring more and more.
-   Thus, to know when enough is enough, is always enough. 
{:.verse}

### **47** Traveling
不出戶知天下；不闚牖見天道。其出彌遠，其知彌少。是以聖人不行而知，不見而名，不為而成。

-   Not leaving the house, you can know all under Heaven;
-   Not peeking out the window, you can see Heaven’s Dao.
-   The farther you go, the less you will know. 
-   Thus, the Sage does not travel but knows, 
-   Not seeing but recognizing,
-   Not acting but accomplishing.
{:.verse}

### **48** Unlearning
為學日益，為道日損。損之又損，以至於無為。無為而無不為。取天下常以無事，及其有事，不足以取天下。

-   Accruing knowing day by day, decreases the Dao day by day.
-   Decreasing knowing again and again, returns it back to Wu Wei.
-   Not forcing actions, yet nothing is undone.
-   
-   Matters run their own course under Heaven,
-   And taking matters in one hand will not be enough to acquire what under Heaven.
{:.verse}

### **49** Unbiased
聖人無常心，以百姓心為心。善者，吾善之；不善者，吾亦善之；德善。信者，吾信之；不信者，吾亦信之；德信。聖人在天下，歙歙為天下渾其心，百姓皆注其耳目，聖人皆孩之。

-   The Sage’s heart is impermanent,
-   Using ordinary people’s heart as their own.
-   
-   To the Good, they are good towards;
-   To the Not-Good, they are also good towards;
-   De (Virtuous Goodness) is trust.
-   
-   The Sage under Heaven, without bias and transparent heart,
-   All people pay attention with their ears and eyes,
-   the Sage is always childlike. 
{:.verse}

### **50**  Life and Death
出生入死。生之徒，十有三；死之徒，十有三；人之生，動之死地，十有三。夫何故？以其生，生之厚。蓋聞善攝生者，陸行不遇兕虎，入軍不被甲兵；兕無所投其角，虎無所措其爪，兵無所容其刃。夫何故？以其無死地。

-   Emerging to live, to enter death.
-   Those who believe in life: three out of ten;
-   Those who believe in death: three out of ten;
-   People living recklessly to their deaths: three out of ten.
-   Why is this so?
-   Because living like so, is to perpetuate living. 
-   
-   Stories were told of individuals good at preserving life, 
-   Traveling across the land not encountering rhinos nor tigers,
-   Walking through armies not suffering harm from weapons;
-   
-   Rhinos have nowhere to land their horn,
-   Tigers have nowhere for their claws to capture,
-   Weapons have nowhere for their edge to hold.
-   How is this so?
-   Because death has nowhere to enter. 
{:.verse}

### **51** De (Profound Virtue)
道生之，德畜之，物形之，勢成之。是以萬物莫不尊道而貴德。道之尊，德之貴，夫莫之命常自然。故道生之，德畜之；長之育之；亭之毒之；養之覆之。生而不有，為而不恃，長而不宰，是謂玄德。


-   The Dao gives birth, De (Virtue) nurtures, matter gives form, conditions complete it.  
-   Therefore there are none that don’t honor the Dao nor esteem De (Virtue).
-   The Dao is honorable, Virtue is precious, thus no commands are needed, it comes naturally.
-   
-   Therefore the Dao gives birth, and De (Virtue) nurtures;
-   Growing, educating them;
-   Stabilizing, regulating them;
-   Raising, covering them.
-   
-   Living without owning,
-   Acting without presuming,
-   Growing without killing,
-   This is called the Profound De (Virtue).
{:.verse}

### **52** Roles
天下有始，以為天下母。既得其母，以知其子，既知其子，復守其母，沒身不殆。塞其兌，閉其門，終身不勤。開其兌，濟其事，終身不救。見小曰明，守柔曰強。用其光，復歸其明，無遺身殃；是為習常。

-   The world has a beginning, with things recognizing it as mother. 
-   Know the mother in order to know what it means to be a son, 
-   Knowing the role of son, means returning to protect the mother,
-   If there’s no body, there is no danger.
-   
-   Shut the mouth,
-   Close all gates,
-   Live long not laboriously.
-   
-   Opening the mouth,
-   Meddling in affairs, 
-   A long life won’t be preserved.
-   
-   Perceiving the miniscule means insight,
-   Protecting the soft means strength.
-   Using the light, returning back to enlightenment,
-   Leaving behind life’s calamities;
-   Practice these habits constantly.
{:.verse}

### **53** Conventions
使我介然有知，行於大道，唯施是畏。大道甚夷，而民好徑。朝甚除，田甚蕪，倉甚虛；服文綵，帶利劍，厭飲食，財貨有餘；是謂盜夸。非道也哉！

-   Make use of my knowledge to correctly walk aside the Great Dao, cautious of straying from it.
-   
-   The Great Dao is very accessible, yet people take paved roads.
-   When the courts are extremely superficial,
-   the field are overgrown with weeds,
-   the granaries empty;
-   
-   Clothed in fine silk,
-   Carrying sharp swords,
-   Satiated with find food and drink,
-   Hoarding an excesses of goods and wealth;
-   as if thieves boasting.
-   This is not the Dao!
{:.verse}

### **54** Cultivation
善建不拔，善抱者不脫，子孫以祭祀不輟。修之於身，其德乃真；修之於家，其德乃餘；修之於鄉，其德乃長；修之於國，其德乃豐；修之於天下，其德乃普。故以身觀身，以家觀家，以鄉觀鄉，以國觀國，以天下觀天下。吾何以知天下然哉？以此。

-   Good foundations cannot be pulled out,
-   Good embracers cannot be shed off,
-   Offsprings offering offerings will not end.
-   
-   Cultivate the self within,
-   And De (virtue) will be genuine;
-   Cultivate the family, 
-   And De (virtue) flows out;
-   Cultivate the country,
-   And De (virtue) will be abundant;
-   Cultivate the Earth,
-   And De (virtue) will be everywhere.
-   
-   Hence, the body looks after the body,
-   The family looks after the family,
-   The country looks after the country,
-   The Earth look after the Earth.
-   
-   How do I know all under Heaven will act thusly?
-   Because of this. 
{:.verse}

### **55** Newborn Baby
含德之厚，比於赤子。蜂蠆虺蛇不螫，猛獸不據，攫鳥不搏。骨弱筋柔而握固。未知牝牡之合而全作，精之至也。終日號而不嗄，和之至也。知和曰常，知常曰明，益生曰祥。心使氣曰強。物壯則老，謂之不道，不道早已。

-   Containing Profound De (virtue) is like being a newborn baby.
-   Wasps, scorpions, venomous snakes do not sting nor bite,
-   Ferocious beasts do not seize,
-   Birds of prey do not snatch.
-   
-   Weak bones, soft muscles, yet is able to grasp firmly. 
-   Not knowing the union of Man and Woman, but is complete,
-   this is Jing (essence) at its most.
-   Crying all day long but is not hoarse,
-   this is harmony at its most.
-   
-   Knowing harmony is everlasting,
-   Knowing the everlasting is enlightenment,
-   Fostering vitality is auspicious.
-   
-   Qi sent to the Heart is strong.
-   All things that strengthen will lead to old age,
-   This cannot be called the Dao,
-   not following the Dao means an early end.
{:.verse}

### **56** Profound Unity (Xuan Tong)
知者不言，言者不知。塞其兑，閉其門，挫其銳，解其分，和其光，同其塵，是謂玄同。故不可得而親，不可得而踈；不可得而利，不可得而害；不可得而貴，不可得而賤。故為天下貴。

-   Those that know do not speak,
-   those that speak do not know.
-   Stuff the openings,
-   close the doors,
-   dampen the acuity,
-   unravel the components,
-   become one with the light,
-   together with dust,
-   this is called the “Profound Unity” (Xuan Tong). 
-   
-   Thus, not being able to obtain it is to be intimate with it,
-   not being able to obtain it is to be estranged from it;
-   Not being able to obtain it is beneficial,
-   Not being able to obtain it is harmful;
-   Not being able to obtain it is noble,
-   Not being able to obtain it is humbling.
-   Thus, under Heaven, it is noble. 
{:.verse}

### **57** Law and Order
以正治國，以奇用兵，以無事取天下。吾何以知其然哉？以此：天下多忌諱，而民彌貧；民多利器，國家滋昏；人多伎巧，奇物滋起；法令滋彰，盜賊多有。故聖人云：我無為，而民自化；我好靜，而民自正；我無事，而民自富；我無欲，而民自樸。

-   In order to properly govern a nation,
-   use military armies with surprise,
-   not forcing matters into one hand.
-   How do I know this? 
-   By this:
-   
-   When the world has many taboos, commoners become extremely poor;
-   When the commoners have many sharp weapons, the Motherland will grow muddle-headed;
-   When there are many people of cleverness and talent, strange things spurt up;
-   When law and order grow more and more, more robbers and thieves appear.
-   
-   Thus the Sage says:
-   {:.indent-3} I partake in Wu Wei,
-   {:.indent-3} And commoners will naturally change;
-   {:.indent-3} I cherish stillness,
-   {:.indent-3} And commoners will naturally straighten;
-   {:.indent-3} I partake in no matters,
-   {:.indent-3} And commoners will naturally be rich;
-   {:.indent-3} I partake in no desires,
-   {:.indent-3} And commoners will naturally come to simplicity. 
{:.verse}

### **58** Extremities 
其政悶悶，其民淳淳；其政察察，其民缺缺。禍兮福之所倚，福兮禍之所伏。孰知其極？其無正。正復為奇，善復為妖。人之迷，其日固久。是以聖人方而不割，廉而不劌，直而不肆，光而不燿。

-   When government is boring and melancholic,
-   the commoners will be pure and honest.
-   When government is overly scrutinizing, 
-   the commoners will be lacking in character.
-   
-   Calamities, ah, blessings depend on them,
-   Blessings, ah, calamities wait in ambush.
-   
-   Who knows what the extremities are?
-   There is no such thing as correct.
-   Correct turns to strange,
-   angels become demons.
-   
-   People’s confusion lasts a long time.
-   
-   Therefore a Sage is honest but not divisive, 
-   sharp but not cutting, 
-   straight but not unrestrained, 
-   bright but not dazzling.
{:.verse}

### **59** Moderation
治人事天莫若嗇。夫唯嗇，是謂早服；早服謂之重積德；重積德則無不克；無不克則莫知其極；莫知其極，可以有國；有國之母，可以長久；是謂深根固柢，長生久視之道。

-   In governing human matters, there is nothing better than moderation.
-   Through moderation, one can be said to have preparations early;
-   Preparations early means to heavily accumulate Virtue (De);
-   Heavy accumulations of Virtue (De) is followed by nothing unrestrained;
-   Nothing unrestrained is followed by no one knowing extremes;
-   Not knowing extremes, they can have the nation as a mother;
-   Having the nation as their mother, they are enduring;
-   This is called having deep roots, strong foundations,
-   Living long, eyes fixed on the Dao.
{:.verse}

### **60** Spirits
治大國若烹小鮮。以道蒞天下，其鬼不神；非其鬼不神，其神不傷人；非其神不傷人，聖人亦不傷人。夫兩不相傷，故德交歸焉。

-   Governing a big nation is similar to cooking a small fish.
-   When the Dao attends to Earth, Spirits won’t act as Gods;
-   It’s not that Spirits lack magic, it's that their magic won’t harm people;
-   Their magic not harming people, the Sage also doesn’t harm people.
-   Both do not harm each other, thus Virtue (de) replenishes each other. 
{:.verse}

### **61** Great Nations
大國者下流，天下之交，天下之牝。牝常以靜勝牡，以靜為下。故大國以下小國，則取小國；小國以下大國，則取大國。故或下以取，或下而取。大國不過欲兼畜人，小國不過欲入事人。夫兩者各得其所欲，大者宜為下。

-   Great nations act as low creeks, the intersection under Heaven, the Valley under Heaven.
-   
-   The female often employs stillness to overcome the male, by not moving from below.
-   Thus, great nations does similar with small nations, to acquire small nations;
-   Small nations does similar with great nations, to acquire great nations.
-   Thus, nations either can be below to acquiesce, or get acquiesced by being below.
-   
-   Great nations don’t want to double the number of mouths to feed,
-   Small nations don’t want to get involved in human politics. 
-   
-   Thus, both desires complement each other, Great nations should act humbly.
{:.verse}

### **62** Cherished
道者萬物之奧。善人之寶，不善人之所保。美言可以市，尊行可以加人。人之不善，何棄之有？故立天子，置三公，雖有拱璧以先駟馬，不如坐進此道。古之所以貴此道者何？不曰：以求得，有罪以免耶？故為天下貴。

-   The Dao is a mystery to all things that exist.
-   It is a treasure to the good, and a refuge to those not-good.
-   Beautiful words can sell in the market,
-   honorable actions can attract people.
-   To those that aren’t good, why abandon them?
-   
-   Therefore, when a Son of Heaven is stood up,
-   and instilled are 3 ministers, 
-   even offering jade and a band of horse,
-   they are not a good an offering as the Dao.
-   Why did they highly value the Dao in ancient times?
-   
-   Is it not said:
-   {:.indent-3}Asking and receive, and if there’s guilt, it is pardoned?
-   
-   Therefore, it is cherished under Heaven. 
{:.verse}

### **63** Approaching Difficulties
為無為，事無事，味無味。大小多少，報怨以德。圖難於其易，為大於其細；天下難事，必作於易，天下大事，必作於細。是以聖人終不為大，故能成其大。夫輕諾必寡信，多易必多難。是以聖人猶難之，故終無難矣。

-   Act by not acting,
-   Work by not working,
-   Taste by not tasting.
-   
-   No matter how big or small, repay resentment back with De (Virtue)
-   Attempt difficulties while matters are easy,
-   Act greatly while matters are small;
-   
-   The most difficult tasks in the world begin with what is easy;
-   the greatest matters in the world begin with what is small.
-   A Sage does not desire Greatness, thus he is able to become Great.
-   
-   Therefore, easy promises lead to scant confidence,
-   Many easiness lead to many difficulties.
-   
-   Thus a Sage approaches difficulties head on and ends up having none in the end. 
{:.verse}

### **64** Seeds
其安易持，其未兆易謀。其脆易泮，其微易散。為之於未有，治之於未亂。合抱之木，生於毫末；九層之臺，起於累土；千里之行，始於足下。為者敗之，執者失之。是以聖人無為故無敗；無執故無失。民之從事，常於幾成而敗之。慎終如始，則無敗事，是以聖人欲不欲，不貴難得之貨；學不學，復衆人之所過，以輔萬物之自然，而不敢為。

-   What is calm is easy to grasp,
-   what hasn’t occurred is easy to plan for.
-   What’s fragile is easy to crumble,
-   what’s tiny is easy to disperse. 
-   
-   Take action before it occurs,
-   take control before chaos erupts.
-   
-   A tree with arms embracing is born from a tiny sprout;
-   A nine-level building is built on tired soil.
-   A thousand-mile journey starts with the foot moving.
-   
-   Forcing things causes losses,
-   grasping for it will inevitably fail.
-   Thus the Sage engages in Wu Wei and nothing is lost;
-   grasping nothing therefore nothing fails.
-   
-   Common people engaging in matters, 
-   often turn their successes into failures.
-   
-   Being careful at the end as if it were the start,
-   and you will have no losses at the end,
-   being a Sage means to desire no desires,
-   not esteeming hard to acquire goods;
-   Learning not to learn,
-   Returning to what the masses pass over,
-   To help all things return back to Zi Ran (nature),
-   as well as not daring to force things.
{:.verse}

### **65** Guiding Principle
古之善為道者，非以明民，將以愚之。民之難治，以其智多。故以智治國，國之賊；不以智治國，國之福。知此兩者亦𥡴式。常知𥡴式，是謂玄德。玄德深矣，遠矣，與物反矣，然後乃至大順。

-   In Ancient times, the Virtuous people of the Dao
-   didn’t enlighten others,
-   but lead them to simplicity. 
-   
-   Commoners are difficult to govern,
-   their knowledge is superflouous.
-   
-   Thus, ruling a country with knowledge is deceitful;
-   Not ruling a country with knowledge, the country will be fruitful.
-   
-   Knowing both these aspects form the guiding principle.
-   Always knowing the guiding principle, 
-   this is called the Xuan De (Profound Virtue).
-   
-   Xuan De is deep, distant, and contrary to all things,
-   but thereupon arrives to the Great Harmony.
{:.verse}

### **66** Humble
江海所以能為百谷王者，以其善下之，故能為百谷王。是以聖人欲上民，必以言下之；欲先民，必以身後之。是以聖人處上而民不重，處前而民不害。是以天下樂推而不厭。以其不爭，故天下莫能與之爭。

-   The rivers and oceans are able to be the King of a hundred valleys,
-   because they lie virtuously below,
-   thus they are able to be the King of hundred valleys.
-   
-   Thus, if the Sage desires to rise above others,
-   their words must certainly be humble;
-   Desiring to be in front,
-   they must certainly place themselves in the rear.
-   
-   Thus the Sage resides above, but people aren’t burdened,
-   They reside in the front, but people aren’t harmed.
-   Therefore, all under Heaven happily push forward, not tiring.
-   Because there is no strife, there is none under heaven who opposes. 
{:.verse}

### **67** Three Treasures
天下皆謂我道大，似不肖。夫唯大，故似不肖。若肖久矣。其細也夫！我有三寶，持而保之。一曰慈，二曰儉，三曰不敢為天下先。慈故能勇；儉故能廣；不敢為天下先，故能成器長。今舍慈且勇；舍儉且廣；舍後且先；死矣！夫慈以戰則勝，以守則固。天將救之，以慈衛之。

-   Everyone under Heaven says my Dao is great, yet it doesn’t seem so.
-   It’s because it is so great, that it doesn’t seem so.
-   If it would seem so, it wouldn’t last long!
-   How tiny it would also be!
-   
-   I have three treasures, I hold and protect them.
-   The first I speak of is Compassion,
-   the second I speak of is Frugality,
-   the third I speak of is not daring to be number one under Heaven.
-   	
-   With Compassion, I can be brave;
-   With Frugality, I can generous;
-   Not daring to be number one, I can be always be worthy of respect. 
-   
-   Today, people give up compassion in lieu of bravery;
-   they give up frugality in lieu of splurges,
-   give up the rear in lieu of the front.
-   ah, death! 
-     
-   Therefore, compassion used in battle brings victory,
-   and used in defense brings protection.
-   
-   Heaven will save those, its compassion safeguards them. 
{:.verse}

### **68** Non-confrontational 
善為士者，不武；善戰者，不怒；善勝敵者，不與；善用人者，為之下。是謂不爭之德，是謂用人之力，是謂配天古之極。

-   Good soldiers do not use force;
-   Good generals do not use anger;
-   Good winners do not play games;
-   Good leaders place themselves below.
-   
-   This virtue is called being non-confrontational,
-   said to be the power of great leaders,
-   said to be aligned with Heaven and the ancient extremities. 
{:.verse}

### **69** Enemies 
用兵有言：吾不敢為主，而為客；不敢進寸，而退尺。是謂行無行；攘無臂；扔無敵；執無兵。禍莫大於輕敵，輕敵幾喪吾寶。故抗兵相加，哀者勝矣。

-   There are words about deploying armies:
-   I dare not play the host, but rather the guest;
-   I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.
-   We can call this to move without moving;
-   Bearing arms without having arms;
-   Confronting without enmity;
-   Executing without weapons.
-   
-   The greatest disaster is underestimating the enemy,
-   Underestimating an enemy means possibly losing my treasures.
-   
-   Hence, when opposing forces are evenly matched,
-   the one who is sorrowful is the one who will prevail. 
{:.verse}

### **70** Instructions
吾言甚易知，甚易行。天下莫能知，莫能行。言有宗，事有君。夫唯無知，是以不我知。知我者希，則我者貴。是以聖人被褐懷玉。

-   My words are extremely easy to know, extremely easy to follow.
-   Yet under Heaven none is able to understand, none able to follow.
-   Words have forms, actions have lords.
-   
-   It is only from lack of understanding, which is why they don’t understand me.
-   Those who understand me are rare, and those that do are precious.
-   Being a Sage is to wear dull cloths, covering jade in the bosom.
{:.verse}

### **71** Sickness
知不知上；不知知病。夫唯病病，是以不病。聖人不病，以其病病，是以不病。

-   Knowledge without thinking is best;
-   Not knowledgeable but thinking is sickness;
-   By being aware of sickness is to be free of said sickness.
-   The Sage is never sick, by being aware of what it means to be sick,
-   thus they won’t get sick.
{:.verse}

### **72** Oppression
民不畏威，則大威至。無狎其所居，無厭其所生。夫唯不厭，是以不厭。是以聖人自知不自見；自愛不自貴。故去彼取此。

-   When commoners don’t fear the mighty,
-   great dreadful forces arrive.
-   Do not encroach where they live.
-   Do not oppress them where they thrive.
-   
-   When there is no oppression, there will be no resentment.
-   Thus the Sage is self-aware and doesn’t show themselves;
-   Loving themselves, but doesn’t think too highly of themselves.
-   Leaving that and taking this.
{:.verse}

### **73** Daring 
勇於敢則殺，勇於不敢則活。此兩者，或利或害。天之所惡，孰知其故？是以聖人猶難之。天之道，不爭而善勝，不言而善應，不召而自來，繟然而善謀。天網恢恢，踈而不失。

-   Daring to be brave brings about death;
-   Daring to not be brave brings about life. 
-   Of these two, which is advantageous and which harmful?
-   What Heaven deems evil, who is to know the reasoning?
-   
-   Thus the Sage approaches both distressfully. 
-   Heaven’s Dao, is uncontestable and good at winning,
-   not speaking, but good at replying,
-   not summoning, but all things come naturally,
-   easy going, but good at executing plans.
-   Heaven’s net is vast and extensive,
-   loose but nothing escapes.
{:.verse}

### **74** Executioners
民不畏死，奈何以死懼之？若使民常畏死，而為奇者，吾得執而殺之，孰敢？常有司殺者殺。夫司殺者，是大匠斲；夫代大匠斲者，希有不傷其手矣。

-   If the people don’t fear death, then how can dying frighten them?
-   It seems using death to always scare people, will cause them to be odd,
-   I will snatch and kill them, those who dare?
-   
-   There are always executioners ready to kill.
-   Thus, being an executioner is like a master craftsman cutting wood;
-   Those who act on behalf of a master craftsman,
-   rarely avoid injuring their own hand.
{:.verse}

### **75** Imbalance
民之飢，以其上食稅之多，是以飢。民之難治，以其上之有為，是以難治。民之輕死，以其求生之厚，是以輕死。夫唯無以生為者，是賢於貴生。

-   The people are hungry,
-   It’s because those above eat too much through taxes;
-   This is why the people are hungry. 
-   
-   The people are hard to govern,
-   it’s because those above interfere too much,
-   this is why they are hard to govern.
-   
-   The people take death lightly,
-   it’s because they pursue life too heavily,
-   that they take death lightly. 
-   
-   Only those that don’t strive to live heavily,
-   those considered worthy of living, are the wise who value living.
{:.verse}


### **76** The weak and strong
人之生也柔弱，其死也堅強。萬物草木之生也柔脆，其死也枯槁。故堅強者死之徒，柔弱者生之徒。是以兵強則不勝，木強則共。強大處下，柔弱處上。

-   When people are born, they are soft and yielding,
-   In death, they are strong and unyielding.
-   All things like grass and wood
-   are born both soft and fragile,
-   when dying becomes dry and brittle.
-   
-   Thus the mighty and strong are disciples of death,
-   while the weak and feeble are disciples of life.
-   
-   Hence violent armies do not lead to victories,
-   too rigid a stick will snap.
-   
-   The great and mighty should reside below,
-   the weak and feeble should reside above.
{:.verse}

### **77** Heaven's Dao
天之道，其猶張弓與？高者抑之，下者舉之；有餘者損之，不足者補之。天之道，損有餘而補不足。人之道，則不然，損不足以奉有餘。孰能有餘以奉天下，唯有道者。是以聖人為而不恃，功成而不處，其不欲見賢。

-   Heaven’s Dao, does it not resemble a bow being drawn?
-   The top pulled down
-   the bottom lifting;
-   having excesses reduced, 
-   having insufficiencies filled
-   
-   The Dao of Humans is not so,
-   We take from those lacking to offer those having an abundance.
-   Who is able to take abundances and distribute them under Heaven,
-   Only those with the Dao. 
-   
-   Thus the Sage acts without relying on force,
-   finishes the work but doesn’t dwell on accomplishments,
-   and not desiring to be seen as virtuous. 
{:.verse}

### *78** Water
天下莫柔弱於水，而攻堅強者莫之能勝，其無以易之。弱之勝強，柔之勝剛，天下莫不知，莫能行。是以聖人云：受國之垢，是謂社稷主；受國不祥，是謂天下王。正言若反。

-   Under Heaven there nothing is more yielding and feeble than water,
-   But for overcoming the strong, there is nothing that is more capable of surpassing,
-   nothing better than water.
-   
-   The weak overcomes the strong,
-   The soft overcomes the hard,
-   Under Heaven there is no one that doesn’t know this,
-   but no one is able to do so.
-   
-   Thus the Sage says, 
-    {:.indent-3}“One who burdens the Country’s shames
-    {:.indent-3}They can be called the ruler of the Earth and grain;
-    {:.indent-3}Burdening a country’s misfortunes,
-    {:.indent-3}They can be called the King of the World.”
-   True words seem to oppose each other.
{:.verse}

### **79** Grievances
和大怨，必有餘怨；安可以為善？是以聖人執左契，而不責於人。有德司契，無德司徹。天道無親，常與善人。

-   Resolving big grievances,
-   there will certainly still be more and more grievances;
-   Peacefully, how can we do good?
-   
-   Thus the Sage grasps the mercy and forgiveness,
-   And does not reproach people.
-   
-   Having De (Virtue) means maintaining the contract,
-   Those without De (Virtue) break the contract.
-   
-   Heaven’s Dao has no relatives,
-   but is often intimate to those that are good.
{:.verse}

### **80** Home
小國寡民。使有什伯之器而不用；使民重死而不遠徙。雖有舟輿，無所乘之，雖有甲兵，無所陳之。使民復結繩而用之，甘其食，美其服，安其居，樂其俗。鄰國相望，雞犬之聲相聞，民至老死，不相往來。

-   Have a small country, with scant people.
-   Even if there are a hundred tools for control, use not one of them;
-   Make people wary of death and not wanting to leave far from home.
-   
-   Though there might be boats and carriages,
-   There is no reason to ride them;
-   Though there are soldiers in armor,
-   There is no reason to lay them out. 
-   
-   Encourage people to return back to tying knots in ropes,
-   Sweet is their food,
-   Beautiful are their clothes,
-   Calm are their dwellings,
-   Delightful are their customs.
-   
-   Neighboring countries look towards each other,
-   Roosters and dogs, their voices can be heard, 
-   But people grow old and die,
-   never wanting to go anywhere. 
{:.verse}

### **81** Sage's Dao 
信言不美，美言不信。善者不辯，辯者不善。知者不博，博者不知。聖人不積，既以為人己愈有，既以與人己愈多。天之道，利而不害；聖人之道，為而不爭。

-   Truthful words are not beautiful,
-   Beautiful words are not truthful.
-   
-   Those who are Good do not argue,
-   Those that argue are not Good.
-   
-   Those that know aren’t knowledgeable,
-   Those that are knowledgeable do not know.
-   
-   The Sage does not accumulate.
-   The more they serve others, the more they gain,
-   The more they give to others, the more abundant they are. 
-   
-   Heaven’s Dao,
-   Does good and doesn’t harm;
-   The Sage’s Dao,
-   is to act without complaint.
{:.verse}
