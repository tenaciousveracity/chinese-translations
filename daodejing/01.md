# **1** The Dao

The Dao that is possibly the Dao is not the everlasting Dao.

A name that can be named is not the everlasting name.

Nameless since the beginning Heaven and Earth;

Named “Mother” by all that exists.

Thus eliminating desire it beholds you its glory,

Desiring for it, beholds you its boundaries.

These two aspects, together form the mystery.

A mystery within a mystery, the door to the Universal Truth.
