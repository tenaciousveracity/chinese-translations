### **1** The Dao
道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名。无名天地之始；有名万物之母。故常无欲，以观其妙；常有欲，以观其徼。此两者，同出而异名，同谓之玄。玄之又玄，衆妙之门。

-   The Dao that is possibly the Dao is not the everlasting Dao.
-   A name that can be named is not the everlasting name.
-   Nameless since the beginning Heaven and Earth;
-   Named “Mother” by all that exists.
-   Thus eliminating desire it beholds you its glory,
-   Desiring for it, beholds you its boundaries.
-   These two aspects, together form the mystery.
-   A mystery within a mystery, the door to the Universal Truth.
{:.verse}

### **2** Comparisons
天下皆知美之为美，斯恶已。皆知善之为善，斯不善已。故有无相生，难易相成，长短相较，高下相倾，音声相和，前后相随。是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教；万物作焉而不辞，生而不有。为而不恃，功成而弗居。夫唯弗居，是以不去。

>-   Under Heaven, all know beauty from the beautiful, and likewise with ugly. 
>-   All know good from the virtuous, and likewise with wickedness. 
>-   Therefore, existence and non-existence give rise to each other,
>-   Difficultness and easiness complement each other, 
>-   Long and short give rise to comparisons,
>-   Highs and lows turn into each other, 
>-   Voice and sound harmonize one another,
>-   Front and back follow one another.
>-   
>-   Thus, the Sage lives in the state of Wu Wei in matters, conducting no speech and no teachings;
>-   All things come into creation never departing, living and not living. 
>-   Acting and no reliance, success will not reside. 
>-   Thus by not dwelling, it never departs.

### **3** Wu Wei
不尚贤，使民不争；不贵难得之货，使民不为盗；不见可欲，使心不乱。是以圣人之治，虚其心，实其腹，弱其志，强其骨。常使民无知无欲。使夫知者不敢为也。为无为，则无不治。

-   Not esteeming the talented prevents strife among people;
-   Not hoarding valuable goods prevents thievery among people;
-   Not seeing desires and temptations prevents hearts from confusion.
-   Thus a Sage governs by emptying desires, filling bellies, weakening ambitions, and strengthening bones.
-   
-   Continuously empty people’s desires so that schemers dare not act. 
-   Act in accordance with Wu Wei and nothing will be ungoverned.

### **4** Ancestor
道冲而用之或不盈。渊兮似万物之宗。挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘。湛兮似或存。吾不知谁之子，象帝之先。

-   The Dao rushes out, used but never emptied.
-   How profound, all things appear to take after it.

-   Dampen the sharpness,
-   Separate out the confusion,
-   Likewise with brightness
-   Along with dust.
-    
-   Deep within, it seems to exists.
-   I do not know who’s offspring it is,
-   Appearing as the ancestor of all things.
{:.verse}

### **5** Straw Dogs
天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；圣人不仁，以百姓为刍狗。天地之间，其犹橐龠乎？虚而不屈，动而愈出。多言数穷，不如守中。

-   Heaven and Earth are not benevolent, 
-   because to them all things are like sacrificial offerings;
-   The Sage is not benevolent,
-   likewise seeing common people as straw dogs.

-   The space between Heaven and Earth,
-   is it not like a bellow, blowing in and out?
-   The more it moves, the more comes out.
-   The more words said, the less they matter,
-   Not as good as holding the Center.
{:.verse}

### **6** Valley Spirit
谷神不死，是谓玄牝。玄牝之门，是谓天地根。绵绵若存，用之不勤。

-   The Valley Spirit never dies, it is called the Mystic Valley.
-   The Mystic Valley is a door, said to called Heaven and Earth’s root.
-   Continuous and unbroken as it builds up, using it requires no labor.
