# **2** Comparisons
Under Heaven, all know beauty from the beautiful, and likewise with ugly. 

All know good from the virtuous, and likewise with wickedness. 

Therefore, existence and non-existence give rise to each other,

Difficultness and easiness complement each other, 

Long and short give rise to comparisons,

Highs and lows turn into each other, 

Voice and sound harmonize one another,

Front and back follow one another.


Thus, the Sage lives in the state of Wu Wei in matters, conducting no speech and no teachings;

All things come into creation never departing, living and not living. 

Acting and no reliance, success will not reside. 

Thus by not dwelling, it never departs.
